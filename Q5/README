Dependencies:
        * Python3 dependencies (installed via pip):
                * numpy
                * random
                * math

How to run:
        * Run the main.py file with python3 to get the bit error rate. The first argument to the file should be the type of modulation to be used.
                $ python3 main.py <modulator>
        * Run without any arguments to get the usage of the file.
                $ python3 main.py

Tested on:
        * Linux kernel version: 6.1.12-arch1-1
        * Python version: 3.10.9

Note that all the plots are stored in the "plots" directory

Note:
The code may throw a runtime warning. But it is safe to ignore this warning
