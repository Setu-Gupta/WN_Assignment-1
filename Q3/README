How to build:
        * Run make in the current directory. This will build the executables for server and client both
                $ make -j

How to clean built files:
        * Run make clean
                $ make clean

How to run:
        * On the server side:
                * First build the code by running make
                        $ make -j
                * Then run the server executable with the first and only argument as the port to be used
                        $ ./server <port>
                * To save the latency in a file, use output redirection
                        $ ./server <port> > <file.csv>
        * On the client side:
                * First build the code by running make
                        $ make -j
                * Then run the client executable with the first argument as the IP address of the server and the second argument as the port
                        $ ./client <IP> <port>

Tested on:
        * Linux kernel version: 6.1.12-arch1-1
        * GLibc version: 2.37

Note: The generated CSV files are named wired.csv and wireless.csv
